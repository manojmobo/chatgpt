# Laravel Project

This repository contains a minimal Laravel project skeleton. Dependencies are not included due to environment constraints. To set up the project, run:

```
composer install
```

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and generate an application key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

This skeleton includes only a basic route returning a welcome string.
